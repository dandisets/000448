description: Time-lapse recordings for the investigation of the relationship between
  the electroporation efficiency of nsEP and changes in the transmembrane potential
  (TMP). A strobe imaging synchronized with nsEP exposure was used. This allowed studying
  the nanosecond kinetics of TMP charging and relaxation, which is the primary effect
  of nsEP that rapidly charges the plasma membrane. The methodology involved pulsed
  laser fluorescence microscopy with voltage-sensitive FluoVolt dye-loaded cells that
  respond to TMP changes within nanoseconds. This dye has a high sensitivity of about
  10 % Ã„F/F per 100 mV. During the study, a single short pulse laser flash is delivered
  at a precise time interval before, during, or after nsEP exposure. The camera shutter
  opens in advance of and closes after the laser flash, capturing one TMP image per
  nsEP exposure. Multiple nsEP and laser flash combinations with programmed time interval
  increments or decrements were delivered to capture the time course of TMP during
  and after nsEP. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
