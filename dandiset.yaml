description: The dataset includes a schematic preview of experimental procedures,
  experiment temperature increase evaluation, and raw image sets of the experiments
  on monolayers of endothelial BPAE and CHO cells. Cells were exposed to various electroporation
  conditions. Cell membrane permeabilization was quantified by YO-PRO-1 (YP) dye uptake
  and correlated to local electric field strength.  Membrane potential kinetics at
  the cathode- and anode-facing poles of a cell were evaluated with FluoVolt dye using
  a strobe imaging system synchronized with nsEP exposure. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
